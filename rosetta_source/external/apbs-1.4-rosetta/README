# README for locally modified *developer* version of 
# APBS/iAPBS r1.4 off the GIT repo as of 1/17/2013.
#
# git://git.code.sf.net/p/apbs/code
#
#
# Local edits were made to fit Rosetta's needs.
#
# Edits are...:
#  - iapbs/apbsdrv_() takes two extra arguments
#    double apbsgrid_meta[9] and double apbsgrid_data**.
#    These are to return grid data, such as potential
#    distribution, in memory, avoiding traditional
#    file I/O.
#  - <here>/include/iapbs/iapbs.h
#    The path and the header file are pre-made
#    for easier use of the iapbs (apbs interface).
#    It merely aggregates header include stmts
#    in a proper order.
#
# NOTE:
# The developer version (that is, the copy off GIT)
# is different from the official source distribution off
# sourceforge.  The developer version comes with
# cmake files set to build the interface iAPBS among other
# controls.

Run make.sh to get all necessary librareies and interfaces built
 and installed in to <here>/lib and <here>/include,
where <here> is replaced by the directory in which this README is found.

All librarie are built as static libraries (i.e. archives of object files), 
which makes it easier for you.  But, if you would like to build shared versions,
 modified the macro "BUILD_SHARED_LIBS" passed to cmake
from make.sh to "on" like this:

-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON

Also, you can build debug version by setting "on" the "ENABLE_DEBUG" macro 
passed to cmake in make.sh.

-DENABLE_DEBUG


In your app, include the header:

#include <iapbs/iapbs.h>


To link your app to the APBS/iAPBS (APBS with C API), set linker flags 
and compiler flags like this:

P=/path/to/<here>
g++ myapp.cpp -o myapp -I${P}/include -I${P}/include/apbs -I${P}/include/maloc ${P}/src \
${P}/lib/libipbs.a ${P}/lib/libapbs_routines.a ${P}/lib/libapbs_mg.a \
${P}/lib/libapbs_generic.a ${P}/lib/libapbs_pmgc.a ${P}/lib/libmalloc.a \
-lz
