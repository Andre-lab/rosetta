After checking out a fresh version run these commands to
get a full release build of mini:


./make_project.py all
cd build_release
cmake .
make


you can also make individual executables by typing, for example

make score_jd2
make relax
make minirosetta

or individual sub libraries:

make core



If you want to see the actual g++ commands the make issues (good for debugging)
issue the command like this

make VERBOSE=1
