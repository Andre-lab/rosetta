How to use ninja to compile much faster.

1. Download the latest version of cmake. Edit the line in CMakeCache.txt:

 CMAKE_ENABLE_NINJA:BOOL=FALSE

to be

 CMAKE_ENABLE_NINJA:BOOL=TRUE

[you may not need to do this in the future if the cmake developers turn ninja on by default.]

  Then compile and install cmake. Run 
 
python bootstrap.py  
make
sudo make install

2. Download ninja via github:

 git clone https://github.com/martine/ninja.git

 and run 

   python bootstrap.py


3. Then, in cmake, replace make with ninja as follows:

./make_project.py all
cd build_release
cmake -G Ninja
ninja

  Or use:

ninja -v

  to see all the g++ or clang commands.
