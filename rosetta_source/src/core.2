so because of the library split for some reason, if you type "scons" instead of "scons bin" or "scons bin pilot_apps_all", scons will look for a path called src/core.1, src/score.2 etc and die when it cant find them. 

There has got to be some way to fix this, but its 4 AM and I've run out of brain

By the way, scons is pretty terrible.


Also, git seemed like a good idea, but let me tell you it gives you more than enough room to completely screw yourself in ways you cant even understand.  The plot of Primer makes more sense than our commit tree does.
