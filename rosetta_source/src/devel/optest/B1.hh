/// What to do:
/// Uncomment the magic four functions below:
/// The default construtor, the destructor, the copy
/// constructor, and the assignment operator.
/// Uncomment these functions in the .cc file as well
/// Replace the #inclusion of A.hh with A.fwd.hh in this file
/// Try to compile C1.cc
///
/// ALSO TEST:
/// First:  Uncomment the four functions below from here and the .cc file.
/// and replace the #inclusion of A.hh with A.fwd.hh.  C1.cc will compile.
/// Second: Comment out B1's destructor both here and in the .cc file.
/// Third:  Try to compile C1.cc. Can you explain why C1.cc will not compile?
///
/// Try this one-at-a-time removal and readdition with the other
/// three functions.
///
/// ALSO TEST:
/// First:  Uncomment the four functions below from here and the .cc file
/// and replace the #inclusion of A.hh with A.fwd.hh.  C1.cc will compile.
/// Second: Restore the implementation of the "get()" function in B1 to
/// this header, and comment it out from B1.cc.
