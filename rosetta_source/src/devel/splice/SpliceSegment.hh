/* A SpliceSegment is one stretch of residues, which is associated with one or more sequence profiles. SpliceSegment is a class that helps manage these profiles

Two types of input files per splice segment are expected:
pdb-profile match: This file should be formatted as pdb, profile_name:
1y32 L1.1
1y33 L1.1
1ya3 L1.2
.
.
.

Each splice_segment is additionally associated with the sequence profiles mentioned in the pdb-profile match file. These should be
formatted as Rosetta-readable PSSM files*/
