# A list of Rosetta PDB 3-letter codes for saccharide residues mapped to the
# corresponding root and default stereochemistry.

# * Some saccharides with trivial names include an astrerisk in the third column
# to indicate that the stereochemistry (L or D) is inherent to this code or N/A.

# Two maps are created from this data in which each key is a 3-letter code.

# The value for each key of the 1st map is the IUPAC root for that sugar.  For
# example, the 3-letter code for any glucose residue is Glc, and the corres-
# ponding root is "gluc", to which suffixes such as "-ose" or "-osamine" are
# added, as appropriate to the specific ResidueType.

# The 2nd map stores 3-letter codes with their default stereochemistries.

# The data in this file serve a dual purpose:
# 1. The maps are used by internal CarbohydrateInfoManger code for nomenclature
#    purposes, as noted above.
# 2. The map keys are used as a list of "Rosetta-allowed" carbohydrate 3-letter
#    codes.  Any 3-letter codes in a PDB file containing saccharide residues
#    must be converted to one of the 3-letter codes found here.  If a 3-letter
#    code is found in this list, then and only then are the HETNAM records of
#    PDB files parsed to determine specific saccharide ResidueTypes.
