###Additional includes/excludes
#ALL CDR_SET INCLUDEONLY SPECIES Hu #Limit to human cdrs for grafting
#ALL CDR_SET INCLUDEONLY GERMLINE IGKV1 #Limit to only IGKV1 germlines for grafting
#H1 CDR_SET INCLUDEONLY PDBIDS 1HIL 2J88
#L1 CDR_SET INCLUDEONLY CLUSTERS L1-11-1
#L3 CDR_SET EXCLUDE PDBIDS 2J88

###Additional general options
#L1 CDR_SET ONLY_CURRENT_CLUSTER #Only sample in the identified cluster of the CDR.
#ALL CDR_SET CENTER_CLUSTERS_ONLY #Only sample on the center cluster members.

#Profile design - conservative vs cluster profiles.  Normal cluster-based.  Changing not for general use.
#L3 SeqDesign PROFILES CONSERVATIVE #Use basic conservative design for this CDR during high-res Design step:

#H3 GraftDesign WEIGHTS 3.0 #Make H3 sampling at a weight of 3 (3 times al other CDRs)
#ALL GraftDesign WEIGHTS 1.0 #Make sampling of all CDRs at equivalent weight.
