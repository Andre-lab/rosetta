Rotamer Recovery Scientific Benchmark

The rotamer recovery scientific benchmark addresses the question,
"Given the sequence identity and backbone conformation of a
experimentally characterized protein structure, how
accurately can Rosetta predict the conformation of the sidechains?"
Having an accurate answer will:

 a) Inform researchers on the trustworthiness of Rosetta as molecular modeler
 b) Guide tuning Rosetta to improve structural predictions


Input Structures:

The input structures is a selection of the Richardson's Top5200
dataset.  The Top5200 set was constructed as follows.  Daniel Keedy
and others the Richardson Lab clustered all structures in the PDB on
April 5th 2007 into 70% sequence homology clusters.  Each structure
with resolution 2.2A or better and was not filtered by hand was run
through MolProbity.  Then from each group the structure with the best
average resolution and MolProbity score was selected provided it had
resolution at least 2.0A.  All structures from the Top5200 having
between 50 and 200 residues and resolution less than 1.2A were
selected for this benchmark. This leaves 152 structures with 17463
residues.
