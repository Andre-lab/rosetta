# weights fit for sequence and rotamer recovery in large set (189 DNA interfaces < 2.5 A resol.) 2008-10-22, using optE_parallel
# this training set contained at least as many "nonspecific" interfaces as "specific" ones; fitting included amino acids contacting DNA backbone
# this weight set was trained with small hydrogen radii (requires non-standard atom_properties.txt)
# also, solvation DGFREE for Phosphorus was corrected from -24 to -4 in atom_properties.txt
