How to get this sample_source setup:

1) put directory of pdbs into the input/ directory, e.g. 'top8000_chains_eds_70/'

2) run setup_resfiles.py 'python setup_resfiles.py --data_dir top8000_chains_eds_70' to generate generated rosetta_inputs.db3

3) setup the list of structures to use: eg 'ls top8000_chains_eds/ > all_pdbs.list' 

4) if you didn't use top8000_chains_eds_70, edit the '-in:path option in' in flags.TEMPLATE 

5) add this sample_source to features/sample_source/benchmark.list

The Top8000: An Origin Story

Motivation

The Protein Data Bank has grown rapidly in the years since our most recently published quality-filtered structural database, the Top500 (Lovell 2003).  In 2007 we attempted to take advantage of this new data by creating the Top5200.  It maintained similar standards of resolution and structure quality but, due to sheer logistics, required a more automated selection protocol.  Unfortunately, we unintentionally included chains with MolProbity score > 2.0, up to > 2.7 in some cases, although we included only chains from structures with resolution < 2.0 as intended.  In 2010 we implemented a stop-gap successor, the Top4400, by simply eliminating all chains with MolProbity score > 2.0.  This database was inherently suboptimal because no attempt was made to find suitable replacements.

The Top5200 was used for DAK’s backrubs-in-evolution paper (to be published) and the Top4400 was used for JSR’s Validation Task Force paper (to be published), and both have been distributed informally to collaborators, but otherwise neither was fully accepted as our next-generation database (e.g. neither is available on our website).  To facilitate new structural bioinformatics studies, this month (May 2011) we constructed the Top8000 databases of high-quality protein structures.

Methodology

WBA ran “reduce -flip“ on all X-ray structures in the PDB as of March 29, 2011, in order to allow Asn/Gln/His flips throughout the structure, including at interfaces where multimer partners may participate in hydrogen-bonding networks.  He then extracted single protein chains along with any “het” atoms or waters with the same chain identifier.  

Next, for each chain he calculated MolProbity score, an estimate of the resolution at which a structure’s steric clashes, rotamer quality, and Ramachandran quality would be average; thus the average of resolution and MolProbity score is a combined experimental and statistical indicator of structural quality.

In terms of filtering, we eliminated chains that were marked by the PDB as obsolete as of 4/13/2011, retracted in the Murthy UAB scandal, atomically incomplete (<25% of residues with sidechains), or too short (<38 residues according to the MolProbity “oneline” script).    Finally, WBA downloaded the PDB’s chain-level homology clusters as of March 29, 2011 (actually released earlier that week on March 25, 2011).

After conversations with WBA, LND, and JSR, DAK required each chain to have resolution < 2.0, chain MolProbity score < 2.0, ≤ 5% of residues with bond length outliers (> 4σ), ≤ 5% of residues with bond angle outliers (> 4σ), and ≤ 5% of residues with Cβ deviation outliers (> 0.25Å).  He then selected the best chain (in terms of average of resolution and chain MolProbity score) per homology cluster.  There was a small number of ties within clusters (for < 1% of the final chain tallies); these were resolved, arbitrarily but reproducibly, by alphabetical order of PDB ID + single-character chain ID.

This was done separately for 50% (“most stringent” homology filtering), 70%, 90%, and 95% (“least stringent” homology filtering) levels.  The homology filters, to varying levels, prevent redundancy and thus over-representation of certain motifs or substructures.

Originally a filter was planned to eliminate “suspiciously good” chains with resolution > 1, chain MolProbity score = 0.5 (the optimal score), and clashscore = 0 (ditto).  However, we determined that such a filter would eliminate several true “paragons” (truly error-free models), and thus we did not use it.

The “geometry” filters (bond lengths and angles and Cβ deviations) were not used in the Top500, Top5200, or Top4400 – they are new to the Top8000.  Fortunately, these filters eliminate a remarkably small number of clusters, so we gain in quality within each cluster with little loss in quantity of clusters.

Chain MolProbity scores, as opposed to file MolProbity scores, were used here, although in the future we may investigate some alternative that accounts for both or applies some average chain MolProbity score “correction factor” differentially for chains from single-chain vs. multi-chain structures.

Availability of electron density maps from the EDS was tabulated but not used for selection for the “primary” version of the Top8000.  A second version was also compiled in which the availability of a map in the EDS was required during the database creation process for each entry.

Results

MySQL tables were stored on c3po in the top8000 database.  The single-chain PDB files were stored on c3po in /c3po-work/DataSets/top8000/ and on arachne (i.e. mcp) in /labwork/top8000/.

Chain counts without the EDS requirement (the “standard” or “normal” Top8000):
top8000_chains_50   7232
top8000_chains_70   7957 (≈ 8000, thus the name Top8000!)
top8000_chains_90   8562
top8000_chains_95   8825

Chain counts with the EDS requirement:
top8000_chains_eds_50   6107
top8000_chains_eds_70   6663
top8000_chains_eds_90   7138
top8000_chains_eds_95   7342
