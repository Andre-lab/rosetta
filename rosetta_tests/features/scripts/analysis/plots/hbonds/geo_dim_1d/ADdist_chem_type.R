brief_description = "Measure the distance between acceptor heavy atoms and the donor heavy atoms for hydrogen bonds.",


long_description = "
Hydrogen Bonds are chemical contacts between a negatively charged
acceptor group and a positively charged donor group. This script measures
the distance between pairs of donor and acceptor atoms. The A-D distance
can be computed from the coordinates of the atoms, which are stored in the
hbond_site_atoms table. The ADchem_type plot groups A-D distance observations
by the chemical type of the donor group and the chemical type of the acceptor
group displaying them as a lattice of plots.

The null model assumes that in the coordinate frame of the acceptor,
the position of the donor atom is uniformaly distributed in cartesian space.
To compute the density in the radial dimension requires normalizing by
the 1/r^2 so the plotted density of the null distribution is uniform. See
the hbond_null analysis script for more details.

Plotting the log(FeatureDensity + 1) allows high density and low density
aspects of the distribution to be included in roughly the same scale. In other
words, the subplot with the highest density sets the scale for all the plots.
If there is a highly concentrated region this can set the scale large to see
low density aspects of the distribution. The '+ 1' acts a pseudo-count,
making the logarithm of never go below zero. Other choices for the value of the
pseudo count would control minimum value.

The indicator in each subplot counts the number of hydrogen bonds in
each group for each sample source. For example, the red number in the
('aAHX: y', 'dPBA: bb') cell is the number of hydrogen bonds in the
sample source corresponding to the red distribution with an aromatic
hydroxyl acceptor (e.g., in a tyrosine) a protein backbone donor
(i.e., the N-H group of a protein backbone).",
