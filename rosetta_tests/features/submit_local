# This is a command file.

# The contents of this file will be used to create a Bash shell script
# so any legal shell commands can go in this file.

#
# Variable substiution is done using Python's printf format,
# meaning you need a percent sign, the variable name in parentheses,
# and the letter 's' (for 'string').
#
# Available variables include:
#   workdir     the directory where test input files have been copied,
#               and where test output files should end up.
#   minidir     the base directory where Mini lives
#   database    where the Mini database lives
#   bin         where the Mini binaries live
#   binext      the extension on binary files, like ".linuxgccrelease"
#
# The most important thing is that the test execute in the right directory.
# This is especially true when we're using SSH to execute on other hosts.
# All command files should start with this line:
#
# This command files is used for two cluster scripts: submit and analyze
# 'submit' script should prepare all input files and submit them to a condor.
#          After execution of 'submit' is finished root level script will wait until condor queue is
#          empty and create and call 'analyze' script.
#
# 'analyze' script should assume that all condor jobs are finished and can perform all post process
#           calculations thats are necessary. The end result of analyze script is at least two
#           files: results.log and results.yaml. In addition to that all files that was left in
#           output/ directory will be also saved by root script for future references.
