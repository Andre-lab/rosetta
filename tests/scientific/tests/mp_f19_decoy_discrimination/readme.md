## PURPOSE OF THE TEST
The purpose of this test is to evaluate the scientific performance of franklin2019, the default energy function for membrane protein structure prediction and design. Specifically, this probes the ability of franklin2019 to discriminate near-native from non-native decoys. 

## BENCHMARK DATASET
The benchmark dataset includes five targets: Bacteriorhodopsin (BRD7), Fumarate Reductase (FMR5), Lactose Permease (LTPA), Rhodopsin (RHOD), and V-ATPase (VATP). For each target, we are using two sets of decoys. The first set of decoys were generated by Yarov-Yaravoy et al. 2006 [1] through ab intiio folding and include 5,000 models per target. These decoys are between 5-40Å RMSD from the native crystal structure.  The second set of decoys were generated by Dutagaci et al. 2017 [2] through molecular dynamics simulations and include between 75-110 decoys per target. these decoys are between 1-11 RMSD from the native crystal structure. 

To balancce the data, we randomly selected a subset of 100 decoys from the low-resolution set. The same set of random 100 models is used for all testing.

The input files are the PDB coordinate files for each decoy and a span file generated using the mp_span_from_pdb application. 

## PROTOCOL
Each decoy is refined using the RosettaMPRelax protocol with the franklin2019 energy function. The RosettaMPRelax protocol is described in detail in:

This benchmark test takes approximately 2,000 CPU hours. 

## PERFORMANCE METRICS
We use the boltzmann-weighted RMS metric to evaluate decoy discrimination. We chose this metric because it identifes the average RMS, accounting for the likelihood of those structures occuring in nature according to their energies. This metric is further described in:

Pass/fail is defined by comparison of calculated Wrms values for this benchmark with previously established values. The test passes if within +/- 0.5Å of the established value.

## KEY RESULTS
The calculated Wrms values are compared with baseline Wrms values from the ref2015 energy function and previous versions of the membrane energy function. 

## DEFINITIONS AND COMMENTS
The membrane normal and center, in addition to the coordinate frame setup are described in:

## LIMITATIONS
The PNear and Wrms metrics evaluate discrimination based on the root-mean-squared-deviation from the coordinates of the native crystal structure. While this is a good general metric for proteins, it looses information about the membrane. I'm currently thinking about ways to also capture membrane embedding into this metric.
