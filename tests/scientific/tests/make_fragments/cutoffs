cutoffs are defined as a deviation of +0.03 from the medians at different cutoffs
as they were run originally (by me (danpf@uw.edu), sept 2019).  they should not
change often, most improvements that have been made on 'make_fragments' in the
past few years have been changes to databases, rather than core changes to picking.

to compute this median we generate sets of numbers, where each set is all of the
minimum rmsds at 3 different cutoffs [10, 25, 50].  We then compute the median of
this dataset, along with the 25th and 75th percentiles (however these are not used
as part of the cutoff failure check).  When we check for failures, we compare these
medians with the newly calculated medians, and if they differ by 0.03 from my pre-
calculated data then we trigger failure.
