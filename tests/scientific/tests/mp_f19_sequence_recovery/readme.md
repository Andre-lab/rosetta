## PURPOSE OF THE TEST
The purpose of this test is to evaluate the scientific performance of franklin2019, the default energy function for membrane protein structure prediction and design. 

## BENCHMARK DATASET
The benchmark dataset includes 130 alpha-helical and beta-barrel transmembrane proteins, with <25% sequence identity and better than 3.0Ã… resolution. The dataset is a subset of proteins from [1] which have assigned lipid compositions. The dataset modifications are detailed in [2].

The inputs are PDB coordinate files and spanning topology definition files for each protein. The PDB coordinate input files were downloaded from the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes Database. The spanning topology definition files were generated using the mp_span_from_pdb application. 

## PROTOCOL
To evaluate sequence recovery, the fixed-backbone Rosetta design protocol is used to searcch for low energy sequences. The protocol is described in:

The benchmark will take approximately 500 CPU hours. 

## PERFORMANCE METRICS
To evaluate performance of this benchmark, we compute two sets of metrics. The first is sequence recovery, Rseq, which is the fraction of correctly designed positions relative to the number of avaialable positions. We compute this metric over all positions and for each canonical amino acid type. The second metric is the recovery rates for individual amino acids relative to the background probability of guessing a random amino acid type (1 in 20 types, or 5%). This metricc, Naa, is the fraction of amino acids recovered with rates higher than random. 

For Rseq, pass/fail is defined by comparing newly computed with established Rseq values computed in Alford et al. 2019. For Naa, a passing value is defined by Naa > 75%. 

## KEY RESULTS
The key results of this scientific test are twofold: 
	(1) Sequence recovery is high for all amino acid types, not just nonpolar amino acids in the transmmebrane region
	(2) Naa is > 75%, compared with older energy functions for which Naa was generally less than 50%. This previously resulted in design skewed toward nonpolar amino acids, rather than sampling from a diverse palette of chemistries. 

## DEFINITIONS AND COMMENTS
The transmembrane, interface, and bulk solvent, as well as buried vs. surface exposed criteria are described in the folling paper:

## LIMITATIONS
In general, the benchmark should be more balanced between alpha-helical and beta barrel membrane proteins.
