#### Integration test "simple_cycpep_predict_peptoid"

Integration test for the simple_cycpep_predict pilot app.  This generates some poly-D/L-ala backbones with peptoid subunits.

This one tests the symmetrization of glycine maps and the use of custom Ramachandran sampling tables, too, as well as support for peptoids.  The "101" structure is the peptoid equivalent of phenylalanine.
