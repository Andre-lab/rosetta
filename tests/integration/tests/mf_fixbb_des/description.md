Tests GenMeanFieldMover fixed-backbone design use case 

Aliza Rubenstein, aliza.rubenstein@gmail.com

The GenMeanFieldMover predicts an amino acid probability distribution (design) or a rotamer probability distribution (sc) for a given set of designed/packed residues (as determined by TaskOperations).  This use case is on a single-backbone with design.

The test inputs include a protease-peptide complex.  Two residues are designed and then output files (transfac probability distribution) are compared for each run.
