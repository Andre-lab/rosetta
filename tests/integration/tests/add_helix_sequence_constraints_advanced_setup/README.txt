Integration test for the AddHelixSequenceConstraints mover.  This mover is intended to add sequence constraints for helices,
to require the packer to put in negative charges at the N-terminus, positive charges at the C-terminus, and few helix-disfavouring
residues.  The mover also controls the number of alanines.

This version of the test tests the setup of RosettaScripts-accessible advanced features.
