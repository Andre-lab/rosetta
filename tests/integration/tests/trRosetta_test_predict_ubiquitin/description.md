## Description

This test runs the trRosetta full structure prediction pipeline, and confirms that it produces consistent results.  This test attempts to predict the structure of ubiquitin, using an MSA of ubiqutin sequences.  In the non-tensorflow build of Rosetta, this test checks that the trRosetta application exits with a suitable error message.
