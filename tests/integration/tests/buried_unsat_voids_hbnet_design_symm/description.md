#buried\_unsat\_voids\_hbnet\_design integration test

This tests the `buried_unsatisfied_penalty` for design, used in conjunction with the `hbnet_energy` and the `voids_penalty`
energy.  The test tries to create a well-packed pose with buried polar networks, with no buried unsats and few voids
in the core.
 
This version tests the symmetric case.
