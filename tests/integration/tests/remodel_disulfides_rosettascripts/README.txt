Integration tests for placement of disulfide bonds with the RemodelMover in RosettaScripts.  Changes to this test could mean:

--The RemodelMover has changed.
--The core libraries that build disulfides have changed.
--The FastDesign mover (or the packer, or the minimizer) have changed.
--The LayerDesign task operation has changed.
