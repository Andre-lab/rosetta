Integration test for protocols::generalized_kinematic_closure::GeneralizedKIC mover using core::scoring::bin_transitions::BinTransitionCalculator class to perturb before kinematic closure.  Failure of this test means that the BinTransitionCalculator class has changed, that bin transition database files (located in database/protocol_data/generalizedKIC/bin_params/) have changed, or that GeneralizedKIC or the GeneralizedKICperturber have changed.
