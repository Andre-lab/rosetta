Initial test of mirror symmetry and packing/design.

This tests the interaction of mirror symmetry with:
-GenKIC
-packing with design (in the context of FastDesign)
-minimization (in the context of FastDesign)
-the LayerSelector
-TaskOperations (ReadResFile)
-Constraints
-Covalent linkages across mirror-symmetric subunits.
