Integration test for the simple_cycpep_predict pilot app with bond angle and bond length sampling.  This generates some poly-D/L-ala backbones with some D/L-prolines thrown in, sampling with slight distortion of backbone
bondlengths and bondangles allowed.

This test also runs in MPI mode, in which case it also computes RMSD to lowest energy.
