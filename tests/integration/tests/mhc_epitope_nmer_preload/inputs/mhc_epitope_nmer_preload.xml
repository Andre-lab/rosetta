This integration test runs a packing and minimization trajectory with the mhc_epitope scoreterm
turned on.  An MHC constraint is applied, which uses a pre-loaded NetMHCII CSV database file
(generated specifically for this hotspot) to specifically reduce immunogenicity at
that hotspot.  Catalytic residue restrictions are applied, and design is allowed only around the
hotspot.

After execution, the final scoring is done with nmer-based scores that cover the entire pose in the OUTPUT
tag.  This is not used during packing as it is very slow.  If faster SVMs are added in the future, it would
be worthwhile to add this to the packing trajectory as well.

This is a reasonable way of setting up a de-immunization trajectory, with the following caveats:
-Standard design settings (e.g. -ex1 -ex2) should be applied as usual (excluded to reduce test runtime).
-A rather small design shell is being used, once again, to reduce test runtime.
-A single hotspot is selected, though the protein contains multiple hotspots.
-To reduce the design space, a task operation that restricts designable residues to those contained
withn the custom database can be used.  The "unseen score" restriction will generally prevent these
residues from being selected, but eliminating them from design space would reduce the number of rotamers
to sample.  (A resfile is being used for that purpose here.)
-Aggressively designing against immune epitopes tends to produce unrealistic sequences (especially, produces
a lot of Asp and Glu substitutions).  While this protocol favours native residues, tuning of the mhc_epitope
and residue_type_constraints weights is warranted.  Other sequence restrictions, for example using NetCharge
or AAComposition design guidance terms, could also be used here.
