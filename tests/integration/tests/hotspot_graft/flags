# sadly, switching to the improved hbond parameterization causes this
# integration test to change because what previously qualified as a
# hydrogen bond no longer seems to; my guess is that previously bad
# hbond geometry (HA distance too great, most likely) was getting
# labeled as an hbond.  Currently, the integration test is resulting
# in this error message and exiting prematurely:
# protocols.protein_interface_design.filters.HbondsToResidueFilter: found 0 hbond to target residue 198. failing.
# protocols.filters.Filter: Compound logical statement is 0.
