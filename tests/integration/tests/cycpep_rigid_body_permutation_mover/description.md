cycpep\_rigid\_body\_permutation\_mover integration test

This tests the CycpepRigidBodyPermutationMover, which reorients a cyclic peptde part of a pose in 3D space so that it aligns with its own cyclic permutation or inverse cyclic permutation.  This version tests the mover with random permutation and a small amount of jitter.
