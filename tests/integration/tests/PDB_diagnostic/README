Two notes about this test:

1) It depends on the files of AnchorFinder.  Both programs are meant to run on unfiltered PDBs - in fact, both were meant to run on literally the whole PDB.  The convenience sample of PDBs in AnchorFinder is appropriate here; I saw no need to duplicate the data, so this test paths to that one.

2) This test can't run correctly in the absence of the PDB CCD (chemical components dictionary).  The presence of that file (in database/chemical) and the flag -load_PDB_components, and the absence of -ignore_unrecognized_res, is how it's meant to be run.  That file won't be installed usually, and having this test crash because of its absence isn't helpful.
