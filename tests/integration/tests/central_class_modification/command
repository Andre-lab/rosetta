# This test is not an integration test in the traditional sense: it is
# not testing a run of the code.  Instead, this test just examines the
# code itself for a few important central classes.  These are
# important base classes used by everyone, and modifications to those
# classes should be approved by the community (or, let's be serious,
# Andrew).  Failing this integration test does NOT mean something is
# wrong - just that you've changed a file it watches and should be
# prepared to justify your change.
