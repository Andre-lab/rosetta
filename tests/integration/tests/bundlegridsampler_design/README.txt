This test is intended to test the integration of the BundleGridSampler mover with the FastDesign mover
and the LayerDesign TaskOperation.  More generally, it tests the ability to pass other movers to the
BundleGridSampler mover in RosettaScripts.

Note that although the BundleGridSampler is not stochastic, the FastDesign mover is, so that might
be an issue.
