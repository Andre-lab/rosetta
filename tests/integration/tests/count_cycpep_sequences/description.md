Integration test for the count\_cycpep\_sequences app.  This app counts cyclic peptide sequences by brute force, as well as analytically, using
a method derived from Burnside's lemma.  The app checks that the two results are identical, so failure of this test indicates that something
has gone wrong with either the brute-force enumeration or the analytic evaluation.
