Integration test for the simple_cycpep_predict pilot app with cis-pro sampling.  This generates some poly-D/L-ala backbones with some D/L-prolines thrown in, sampling cis and trans omega angles before the prolines.  This test also tests the -cyclic_peptide:total_energy_cutoff commandline flag, rejecting solutions with energy values over 100.0.
