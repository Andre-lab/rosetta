This test is intented to test LayerDesign with noncanonical amino acids.  It uses the MakeBundle mover to generate convenient initial geometry for the test.  The test should load the d-caa params files DILE.params, DVAL.params, DLYS.params, DASP.params, and DTHR.params from the database.  These should be OFF by default in residue_types.txt!
