This directory is for storing a copy of the "expected" results from the
integration tests.  This directory does NOT need to be updated after every
little change - it is not meant to be line-for-line accurate or have correct
numbers.  It is meant to capture the structure of the expected results, so that
changes like early aborts can be more readily identified by coders other than
the original test author.  You should include, at the very least:

1) copies of what the expected log files should look like (ignoring
small/numerical changes)
2) at least a list of what files should exist, if not copies of the files
themselves
3) a short README on what the test is supposed to test and anything known to be
odd but okay, like error messages

You should update the expected results when there are major changes, but not
with every checkin.
