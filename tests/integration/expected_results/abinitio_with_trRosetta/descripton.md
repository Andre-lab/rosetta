## Description

This test runs the AbinitioRelax protocol with trRosetta constraints generated internally on-the-fly.  This test attempts to predict the structure of ubiquitin, using an MSA of ubiqutin sequences.  At the time of test creation, an nstruct of 1 reliably produced a structure with an RMSD to native of 2 A or less.
