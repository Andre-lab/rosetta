# This file helps to merge PDB residues that Rosetta prefers to represent with patches.
# Its three fields are tab-separated. Try to keep this up to date with patches!

# THIS IS JUST A LIST FOR UNIT TESTING!
# The actual, current lists are found within the appropriate ResidueTypeSet
# directories in the database:
# database/chemical/residue_type_sets
# If you edit this file, you must also edit merge_and_split_behaviors_io.cxxtest.hh.
