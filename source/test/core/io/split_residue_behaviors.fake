# This file helps to split PDB residues that Rosetta prefers to represent as
# separate residues.

# THIS IS JUST A LIST FOR UNIT TESTING!
# The actual, current lists are found within the appropriate ResidueTypeSet
# directories in the database:
# database/chemical/residue_type_sets
# If you edit this file, you must also edit merge_and_split_behaviors_io.cxxtest.hh.

# The three fields are tab-separated.
# The second column is a semicolon-delimited list of base residue types, given
# as a comma-separated pair of Rosetta 3-letter code and residue name, (NOT
# 3-letter code,) i.e., what one could enter in a Rosetta-formatted HETNAM
# record.
# The third column is a semicolon-delimited grouping of sets of atom renaming
# instructions.
# The sets are ordered in the same manner as the residue names in the previous
# column; that is, the first residue named has its atoms renamed first.
# Within a set of instructions, a hyphen separates the old PDB name from the new
# Rosetta atom name.
# Just like in .pdb files, atom names are all strings of four characters,
# so " HA " is not the same as "HA  "; spaces matter.
