@page rna_thread Documentation for RNA threading and mutation: <em>rna_thread</em>

@section metadata Metadata
Added to documentation: June 2013

@section code_demos Code and Demo
The central code for the <em>rna_thread</em> application is in
<code>apps/public/rna/rna_thread.cc</code>

For a 'minimal' demo example of RNA threading:

<code>demos/public/rna_thread</code>

of the simpler RNA mutation:

<code>demos/public/rna_mutate</code>

@section refs References
This threading code is currently not described in any publication.

@section purpose Purpose
This code is intended to thread new sequences onto previously solved RNA coordinates ('templates') for RNA homology modeling.

@section algorithm Algorithm

@section limits Limitations
@li Within Rosetta, this code does not preserve the fold-tree
@li The code has not been optimized for speed and is not encapsulated into a class yet.

@section inputs Input Files
@subsection required Required files
@li The template PDB file. Must be in Rosetta RNA format (see @ref rna_denovo)
@li An alignment fasta file.  Example:

@verbatim
> GIR1 group-I like ribozyme in I-DirI gene from D. iridis
gguuggguugggaaguaucauggcuaaucaccaugaugcaaucggguugaacacuuaau----------------------uggguuaaa-acgg-----------------------------------ugggggacgaucccguaacauccguccuaa---------------------------------cggcgacagacugcacggcccu----------------------------------------------gccucuuagguguguucaau---gaacagucguucc------------------gaaaggaagcauccgguaucccaagacaauc

@endverbatim

If you just want to mutate sequence, can supply this on command line by -seq; see below @ref rna_mutate.

@subsection command_line How to run with this file.
@verbatim
rna_thread.<exe> -in:file:fasta 3bo3_REARRANGE_to_GIR1.fasta -s 3bo3_REARRANGE.pdb  -o 3bo3_REARRANGE_to_GIR1_thread.pdb -seq_offset 63
@endverbatim

This demo threads a group I intron crystallographic structure (3bo3_REARRANGE) into the group-I-like branching ribozyme GIR1, and was used in the fifth RNA puzzle trial.

@section ft_options Options

@verbatim
-in:file:s                     Name of single PDB file with template coordinates
-in:file:fasta                 Name of alignment file in FASTA format. First sequence should be
                                target sequence, and second sequence should template sequence
-o                             Name of output PDB file
-seq_offset                    [optional] Integer to be added to residue numbers for output. [default=0]
-seq                           [alternative to -in:file:fasta] sequence of output PDB. Must have
                                same number of residues as template PDB.
@endverbatim

@section other

If you just want to mutate some positions in an RNA and don't want to create a fasta file, you can run a command line like:

@verbatim
rna_thread -s rosetta_inputs/1zih_RNA.pdb  -seq gggcgcgagccu -o 1zih_A7G.pdb
@endverbatim
