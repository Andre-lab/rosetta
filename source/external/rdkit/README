This is the directory to hook RDKit into the Rosetta build system.

The rdkit.upstream branch contains a version of the RDKit trunk

Currently, it's branched off of the 2020.03 release of RDKit.

Some modification have been made:
* Some autogenerated files are added (mostly YAKK/LEX parsers)
* Some issues with non-pthread builds were addressed.

The update_rdkit.py script was run to do two things:
1) Collect the files to compile, and put them in the rdkit.external.settings file
2) Symlink the needed directories from the rdkit.upstream/Code/ directory to the external/rdkit directory, such that the inclusion mechanism can find them properly.

If you update the version of RDKit to a new release, you'll likely need to repeat the process.
