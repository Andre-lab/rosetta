# To add a new property to Rosetta for use in .params files, patch files, and
# ResidueTypes, simply add a string to this list and run
# update_ResidueType_enum_files.py.
# (You may also consider adding new is_ accessors to ResidueType and Residue.)

# This is Part 1 of a major refactor of the properties system.  Eventually,
# there will be separate lists of properties for separate classifications of
# ResidueTypes as well as a general list of properties.  For now, all
# properties belong in this file.

# Comments added inline with a property will be converted to C++ comments, so
# please feel free to add clarifications/definitions here.

# WARNING: BE CAREFUL NOT TO DUPLICATE A PROPERTY!
