These are notes on the transitioning of the BCL cheminfo items from the BCL to Rosetta. This is just to help with the transition. 
This file should probably be removed/rewritten before this gets merged into master.

First off, licensing issues: Jens Meiler says this is okay. Direct all comments/concerns/questions regarding that to him.

Remember to update the header of all files

Coding Conventions: At least initially, we're attempting to do a minimal transition. 
Many of the internal coding conventions in the transitioned code will be the BCL version, rather than Rosetta ones.
However, the namespacing, file naming and external interface to the code should be Rosetta like. 
It's just the internal details which may stay BCL-like for a while

Commenting notation: Original BCL code that is temporarily or permanently commented out should be commented out with an easily identifiable notation.
I propose //# in the far left of the line.

Quick Reference for BCL -> Rosetta transitions.
------------------------------------------------

BCL_API -- A macro for compiling with Microsoft - delete it.

double -- replace with core::Real
size_t -- replace with core::Size

io::Serialize::Read -- Basically >>, but with more error checks and undefined number support.
io::Serialize::Write -- Basically <<, but with safety checks for undefined numbers (nan, etc.), and indentation support
 --- These I've converted assuming an indent of zero and no nan support (i.e., I've replaced the io::Serialize with stream operations
 
util::GetUndefined< double >() -- use numeric::get_undefined_real()  in numeric/util.hh
util::GetUndefined< size_t >() -- use numeric::get_undefined_size()  in numeric/util.hh

util::ObjectInterface -- defines general hooks. Can delete. May need to define new >> and << operators, though.
