/// @brief Classes for informally monitoring loop modeling simulations.
///
/// @details Most of the classes in this namespace just keep track of simple 
/// statistics regarding the loop modeling simulation and report them to 
/// stdout.  This information is more intended for debugging and diagnostic 
/// purposes than it is for analysis.  If you are interested in recording 
/// information to be be used for analysis, consider the FeaturesReporter 
/// framework.
