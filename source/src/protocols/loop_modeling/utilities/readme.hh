/// @brief Generally useful loop-sampling meta-algorithms.
///
/// @details This namespace contains generally useful LoopMover subclasses that
/// don't directly perform loop sampling.  For example, the PeriodicMover and 
/// RepeatedMover classes just control how often a given loop mover is called.  
/// The LoopMoverGroup classes makes it easy to work with a collection of loop 
/// movers.
