///
/// @brief Generally useful loop-sampling meta-algorithms.
///
/// @details This namespace contains generally useful LoopMover subclasses that
/// don't directly perform loop sampling.  For example, the AcceptanceCheck 
/// class makes it possible create protocols with additional acceptance checks.  
/// The LoopMoverGroup class makes it easy to work with a collection of loop 
/// movers.
