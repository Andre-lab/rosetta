jd2test readme

jd2test.cc is not a "real" application.  It exists as a simple integration test for checking jd2 behavior for FileSystemJobDistributor, PDBJobInputter, and PDBJobOutputter (the general defaults).  The application does not do any real modeling (a trivial packing operation restricted to a few residues), just enough that the output PDBs will differ.  DO NOT under any circumstances attempt to do science with it.  DO use it as a template for your own code.
