Sampler classes:
- Responsible for generating new structures.
- Examples: 
    - StandardKic: Perturb loop and refine
    - BalancedKic: Perturb with balance
    - MonteCarloKic: Make small moves
    - WiggleKic: Allow endpoints to wiggle

Sampler Variants:
- Make it easy to experiment with different algorithms.
- Examples:
    - BalancedKic with different side chain movers
    - StandardKic with and without refinement

Monte Carlo:

-----------------

Fundamentally there needs to be a loop.  In practice this seems to be a nested 
loop, but I should be able to turn any loop into a nested loop.

Within the loop:
- Sample
- Filter (one or more)
- Refine (one or more)
- Accept

-----------------

LoopMover
- Contains a list of components, or tasks.
- Each task has an apply function which:
    - Accepts a non-const pose.
    - Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the move should be rejected 
      out of hand.
- The mover implements the following algorithm:
    - Pick a loop to sample.
    - Invoke each task in turn, stopping if any returns false.
    - Decide whether or accept or reject the move.

LoopProtocol
- Manages the for-loops around the LoopMover.
- Contains a list of ForLoopTasks.  Each task corresponds to a for-loop and is 
  responsible for controlled what that for-loop does.  Some examples:
    - RampTemperatureTask
    - RampScoreWeightsTask
    - IterateTask - Doesn't do anything, just loops the specified number of 
      times.
