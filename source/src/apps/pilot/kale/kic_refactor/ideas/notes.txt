Every loop conformation the algorithm comes up with is worse than the original.  
So the only moves that are accepted are those where the algorithm restores the 
starting structure because it can't find any new solutions.

This brings up an interesting point about how to accurately quantify the 
acceptance rate.  I want to know how many novel conformations were accepted and 
how many conformations were simply restored.  This would be a good thing to 
have a logger for, if possible.  I might need some information that's pretty 
internal to the StandardKicSampler.
