I need to:
==Get termini for D-amino acids working. --> DONE
==Check rama derivatives --> OK
==Replace the D-aas with the icoor_05_09 versions --> DONE
==Check fa_dun --> FIXED (derivatives too).
==Check library loading for fa_dun --> NON-ISSUE, since D-amino acids now use the L-libraries
==Check p_aa_pp --> FIXED (derivatives, too)
--Problem with p_aa_pp and rama: gly in the context of D-amino acids not scored properly due to asymmetric prob distn's.
==Check how the packer works (it doesn't pack D-amino acids right now) --> FIXED
==Check pro_close --> FIXED
==Check pro_close derivatives --> FIXED
==Check reference energies --> FIXED
==Check reference energy derivatives --> DUH.  Reference energy derivs are all zero
==Check hbonding --> FIXED
==Check hbonding derivatives --> FIXED
==Check omega --> Seems fine.
